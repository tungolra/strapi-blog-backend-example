### Blogsite with Strapi and NextJS

### About 
This repo contains the frontend files for a Blog site. I followed a tutorial from Strapi's docs to launch this application. Using a headless CMS enabled me to quickly build a full-stack application where RESTful APIs and routing functionality were abstracted through Strapi's CMS. Web pages were seamlessly built through use of NextJS's dynamic routing and Tailwind CSS's convenient utility-first framework.
